## Setup

```{r setup}


library(tidyverse)
library(emmeans)
library(psych)
library(multcomp)
```

## Data Creation

**reminder for future Rowan and anyone else that this is completely fake data that should never actually be used for a real paper!!**

First, I am simulating the data for each of my four conditions. My goal was to create four groups of 40 participants (total N = 160) where the overall reaction time was 450 ms with a standard deviation of 50 ms. In line with my hypothesis, I would like the richness group to have a significantly higher reaction time (i.e., about 2 standard deviations or 100 ms higher) than any other group. Here are the benchmarks I set for means and SDs for each of the four groups:

Control: 425 ms (50)
Happiness: 450 ms (50)
Meaning: 475 ms (50)
PR: 575 ms (50)

```{r data-creation}


# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(57)

# Function to generate simulated data for each of the four conditions
generate_simulated_data <- function(condition_name, num_participants, mean_reaction_time, std_deviation) {
  tibble(
    condition = condition_name,
    participant_id = 1:num_participants,
    reaction_time = rnorm(num_participants, mean = mean_reaction_time, sd = std_deviation)
  )
}

# Parameters for each condition (making sure there are 160 unique cases created)
control_data <- generate_simulated_data("Control", 40, 425, 50)
happiness_data <- generate_simulated_data("Happiness", 40, 450, 54) %>%
  mutate(participant_id = participant_id + max(control_data$participant_id))
meaning_data <- generate_simulated_data("Meaning", 40, 475, 52) %>%
  mutate(participant_id = participant_id + max(happiness_data$participant_id))
richness_data <- generate_simulated_data("Psychological Richness", 40, 575, 55) %>%
  mutate(participant_id = participant_id + max(meaning_data$participant_id))


# Combine data from all four conditions
combined_data <- bind_rows(control_data, happiness_data, meaning_data, richness_data)

# Convert the "condition" variable to a factor with specified levels
combined_data$condition <- factor(combined_data$condition, levels = c("Control", "Happiness", "Meaning", "Psychological Richness"))

# Print the combined data
print(combined_data)

```

## Data Analysis

Now I will run my analysis: a planned contrast (with coefficients control = 0, happiness = -1, meaning = -1, and psychological richness = 2) testing my hypothesis that participants in the psychological richness condition will have higher (i.e., slower) reaction times than any other well-being condition.

(First checking that my descriptives generally line up with what I wanted them to be)

```{r descriptives}

describeBy(combined_data$reaction_time, combined_data$condition, mat=TRUE)

```


Running an omnibus ANOVA to start:

```{r anova}

model <- aov(reaction_time ~ condition, data = combined_data)
summary(model)

```

Big surprise, it is incredibly significant :)


Now I will run my planned contrast:

```{r contrast-prep}

# verifying my IV levels are what I think they are (and that my turning "condition" into a factor earlier worked)

levels(combined_data$condition)

```


```{r contrasts}


# here is a contrast verifying that the happiness, meaning, and richness conditions have a higher average reaction time than the control group
c1 <- c(-3, 1, 1, 1)
# here is my hypothesized contrast:
c2 <- c(0,-1,-1,2)

# combining the above 2 lines into a matrix:
mat <- cbind(c1,c2)

# defining the contrasts matrix:
contrasts(combined_data$condition) <- mat

# getting results:
model1 <- aov(reaction_time ~ condition, data = combined_data)
summary(model1)
summary.aov(model1, split=list(condition=list("Control vs. Well-Being Conditions" = 1, "Psychological Richness vs. Happiness and Meaning"=2))) 

### (Another method of getting the contrasts: getting the actual contrast values instead of just how they fit into the ANOVA)


# Define the contrasts
contrasts_matrix <- matrix(c(-3, 1, 1, 1, 0, -1, -1, 2), ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)

# Specify the factor variable and the planned contrasts
contrasts_condition <- glht(model1, linfct = mcp(condition = contrasts_matrix))

# Summary of planned contrasts
summary(contrasts_condition)



```
